        <div class="bio">
            <p>Graduated from <a href="https://www.isel.pt/en" target="_blank">ISEL</a> and holding a Master's degree from 
                <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">IST</a>, I have been working in the industry since 1997 when I joined <a href="https://cc.isel.pt/" target="_blank">CCISEL</a> and began my professional career in software engineering and programming. Since then, I have remained consistently involved in industry activities, both through ISEL and by directly integrating into the engineering teams of the companies I have collaborated with. Over the years, I have contributed to teams delivering software used by millions of users, participated in technical leadership groups responsible for solution design and the promotion of best practices, and provided technical guidance to development teams. I have also overseen strategic aspects of software production and maintenance, including the definition of methodologies and procedures for development, delivery, and long-term support. This broad and sustained industry involvement led to the award of the Specialist title by <a href="https://www.ipl.pt/en" target="_blank">IPL</a> in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am an Associate Professor at ISEL, where I coordinate the <a href="https://github.com/isel-leic-pdm" target="_blank">Mobile Devices Programming</a> 
                course in the  <a href="https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/computer-science-and-computer-engineering" target="_blank">LEIC</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.isel.pt/en/curso/bsc-degree/informatics-networks-and-telecommunications-engineering" target="_blank">LEIRT</a> programs. 
                I teach subjects related to programming languages, software design, virtual execution environments, concurrent programming, distributed applications, web development, and the infrastructures that support these systems. Throughout my academic career, I have supervised and evaluated dozens of final projects at both the undergraduate and master's levels, and have played a key role in aligning the LEIC curriculum with industry needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a <a href="https://www.iade.europeia.pt/en/phd/phd-digital-games-development/">PhD in Digital Games Development</a> at IADE and IPCA.
